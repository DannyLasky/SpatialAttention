Code for analyzing data from Conte Center spatial attention task:

Primary files
* S1DurationAnalysis: Behavioral time courses and Fourier analyses for hit rate and reaction time.
* S1MultipleAveragings: More advanced plotting with multiple window lengths for computing behavioral time courses and subsequent Fouriers. This was the primary script for producing figures in my presentations.

Supplementary files
* ThresholdAnalysis: Used early on for viewing my hit rate in response to different orientation changes.
* AttentionAnalysis: Used early on for viewing how my hit rate and reaction times are different for different trial types (valid, invalid, catch).
* S1Bootstrap: Early attempts at performing random permutations and bootstrapping.
  * shadedErrorBar: A function that was used with S1Bootstrap for generating shaded error bars.
